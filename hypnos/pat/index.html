        <p>Welcome to our epic Privacy and Terms document! We aren't very good at writing formal legal documents so here is the bottom note. We don't grab your information, nor do we sell it. This program is free for you to use so please don't exploit it. Don't resell it, don't modify it, don't attempt to recreate it, and just be a decent human being in general. Thanks for your support for this project and enjoy!</p>
